# Mad Libs: Instructions  

[Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) is a phrase template word game. One player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, then reads the story aloud.

If you've never seen mad libs before, it's an interactive story generator. You can see and [online example here](https://www.madtakes.com/libs/178.html).

In this project, you are going to write a Mad Libs game. The program should prompt the user for some words, and then fill in the blanks in the story with those words.

To write the program:
- Write a story of your own and keep it as strings in the program.
- Prompt the user for different words. For example: "Enter a funny word" and "Enter your last name"
- Store all the responses the user entered
- Complete the story by filling the blanks (originally left empty for user input)
- Print out the full story
- (Bonus) Play a computer voice that reads the story out loud.

You are allowed to work together if you like, but it's not mandatory.

Be creative, and have fun!

## Tips and Hints

* You can use lots of print statements, instead of one big one
* Be mindful of your syntax! It's easy to miss a character.
* Be careful about the spaces in your strings. Python won't add extra space, so you need to add it in your code.
* Search for "text to speech python" to find some ready libraries that can play the audio for you
